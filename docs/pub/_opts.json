Fragments in the same file are separated by a delimiter like\n\n    ---- /page-1 ----\n\n**pub-generator** compiles markdown fragments into javascript objects which are rendered to HTML by applying **handlebars templates**.\n\n\n### sources\nSources are directories in your project or inside a theme package. Source directories are scanned, and new files picked up automatically when the source is read.\n\nHandlebars templates live in files in sources just like markdown text. In fact, templates and markdown may live together in the same source file as long as each is clearly identified e.g. (simplified content)\n\n\n    ---- /page-1 ----\n\n    page1 markdown text...\n\n    ---- /main-layout.hbs ----\n\n    <html>{{{renderPage}}}</html>\n\n\n\n### pages and fragments\nThere are 2 kinds of markdown content:\n\n1. **pages** have a \"normal\" page url or href. e.g. `/pages/about-us`\n2. **fragments** have an href with a fragment #id. e.g. `/blog/2014/year-in-review#conclusions`\n\nThe href may be specified in a header at the top of the markdown like the examples above or derived from the source path: E.g. a file `/md/pages/About Us.md` may become `/pages/about-us` assuming `/md` is the source.\n\nFilenames are turned into urls by slugifying i.e. lowercasing and converting non-alphanumeric characters into hyphens.\n\nIn addition to having an href, all pages and fragments may acquire additional metadata from their markdown headers. E.g to set a title for the home page, add the following at the top of the index.md file.\n\n    ---- / ----\n    title: Introduction\n\n    **pub-server** is a lightweight content management tool for publishing on the web\n\n\n### templates and rendering\npub-server invokes compiled templates to render pages.\n\nPage or fragment objects provide the input \"context\" for handlebars. E.g. If a template contains `{{title}}`, handlebars will look for a `.title` property on the current page or fragment object and insert the value of that property into the html output.\n\nTemplate evaluation is performed in a nested manner\n\n- The outer layout template will include a helper like `{{{renderPage}}}`\n- This invokes an inner page template which may render the page markdown using `{{{html}}}` or it may iterate over page-fragments using a block helper like `{{{#eachFragment}}}...{{{/eachFragment}}}`\n\nTemplates may be explicitly specified. E.g. to use an outer template called `hero` instead of the default 'main-layout', specify `layout:hero` in the markdown header. Similarly, to use a page layout called `flow`, specify `template:flow` in the markdown header.\n\n\n### loading\nBefore rendering (or every time a source is modified) the generator does:\n\n- *read* text files in order from all (or just the modified) sources\n- *pre-process* each file into one or more fragments\n- *compile* .md fragments into arrays of javascript objects\n- *compile* .hbs fragments into handlebars templates\n- *emit* events which can trigger additional processing by plugins\n\nPage-fragments are automatically attached to pages during compilation. This makes it easy for templates to iterate over the fragments in a page during rendering.\n```"},{"path":"/python.md","text":"---- ----\ntitle: Python\n\n\n### Python\n```python\n# Copyright 2015 gRPC authors.\n#\n# Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n# you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n# You may obtain a copy of the License at\n#\n#     http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n#\n# Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n# distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n# WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n# See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n# limitations under the License.\n\"\"\"The base interface of RPC Framework.\n\nImplementations of this interface support the conduct of \"operations\":\nexchanges between two distinct ends of an arbitrary number of data payloads\nand metadata such as a name for the operation, initial and terminal metadata\nin each direction, and flow control.
